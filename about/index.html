Development of Mach engine is full-time for me, around ~55h/week, with ad-hoc part-time contributions from others. I additionally hold a full-time position ~48h/week at <a href=https://sourcegraph.com>Sourcegraph</a>.</p><p>In the coming years, I anticipate shifting 100% of my time to Hexops and embarking on a self-funded 10-year journey to make some games. We&rsquo;re not there yet.</p><h2 id=where-are-we-going>Where are we going?</h2><p>One of the reasons I chose to join a dev tools startup out of school instead of going into the gamedev industry is because that industry is so fundamentally broken. From companies like EA games* edging towards quite literally getting children addicted to gambling, to companies like Telltale Games* violating federal labor laws, to companies like Blizzard* having rampant and systemic sexual harrasment in their DNA.</p><p>Feedback from players goes entirely neglected, or leads to empty promises from PR teams. There are pushes for DLC, pre-orders, and early-access games to drive profits. Quality suffers. Even Valve, my favorite game company, <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/ox3fv1/nobody_wants_to_play_an_arena_shooter_from_some/h7kqer6/>neglects their games</a> as their Steam marketplace dominance is more valuable than producing games.</p><p>Game companies are in a race to the bottom-we&rsquo;d like to make this a race to the top by releasing games you <em>want</em> to pay for.</p><p><em>* Allegedly</em></p></div></main></div><div class=footer><a href=/privacy>Privacy matters</a><p><a href=https://devlog.hexops.com/>Hexops' devlog</a> | <a href=/mach>Mach engine</a></p></div></body></html>
