Over the past few years he has been working double-time writing code 100 hours/week working towards executing on a self-funded 10 year game development vision.
Where are we today? Currently Mach engine is where almost all of my time goes, we&amp;rsquo;re laying the groundwork for some future games at present.</description></item><item><title>Mach engine</title><link>https://hexops.com/mach/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hexops.com/mach/</guid><description>We've only just begun Mach engine is only 6 months old, it is still in very early stages of development.
While it is improving rapidly, we encourage being skeptical until we deliver on our promise. Stay tuned.
Low level, but like never before Mach engine is written in the Zig programming language, a successor to C with blazing fast performance, safety, compile-time code execution and more.</description></item><item><title>Privacy matters</title><link>https://hexops.com/privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hexops.com/privacy/</guid><description>Analytics should always be minimal, 100% anonymous, aggregated, and open to the public - otherwise itâ€™s spying. We believe in your right to anonymity and privacy. We believe in creating games worth paying for, not exploiting you for money. Our systems gather the smallest amount of data needed to learn how to actually improve our games, and to prove it we give you and everyone else 100% full access to all our data and tools.</description></item></channel></rss>
